# StockManagement
Title: Stock Management
The system I have developed in Django is a web-based stock management system designed for
small and medium-sized business. It allows users to create and manage products in their shops.
The system was developed using the Django web framework, which is built on the Python
programming language. It also utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end, as well
various Django plugins and libraries for added functionality.
The System architecture follows a Model-View-Controller(MVC) architecture, with the models
defining the data structure, views rendering the user interface and controllers handling user
requests and interactions. The database schema is designed using Djangoâ€™s Object-Relational
Mapping (ORM) system, which allows for easy database management and querying. The
database used was PostgreSQL.
One of the key features of the system is its user authentication system, which allows users to
create accounts and securely log in. The product management system is another important
feature which allows user to manage products which are available in the stock. Sells
management system is also another feature which user manage sells which has made per day.
System analyze data in form of charts in the dashboard where sum up sells that have been made
per month against product being ordered.
Overall, the system has been proven to be a valuable tool for the medium sized, business,
allowing them to manage products more efficiently and effectively. The user-friendly interface
and real-time updates.
